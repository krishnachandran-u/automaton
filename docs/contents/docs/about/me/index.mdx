Hi there! I'm **Krishnachandran U**, a CS undergrad at the College of Engineering, Trivandrum. 

I’ve worked on a couple of interesting projects and with companies in **Frontend**, **Backend**, and **AI**. I have a deep love for **automata** and **cryptography**, and I’ve also dabbled in **competitive programming**.

You can reach me at:

Thanks for checking out **Pykleene**. I hope you enjoy playing with automata as much as I do!
