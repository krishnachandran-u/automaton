title: What's more 
---

There’s still a lot to be done in **Pykleene**, and I’m excited to continue expanding its capabilities. Here are some of the features and functionalities that are yet to be implemented, and I welcome anyone who’d like to contribute:

- Writing some functions for emptiness, finiteness, and other important properties of regular languages.

- Adding support for simulating **Mealy** and **Moore** machines.

- PDA Membership, Emptiness, and Finiteness Tests

- Membership Problems for Context-Sensitive and Recursive Languages

If you’re interested in contributing or have suggestions for additional features, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Let’s continue making **Pykleene** the go-to library for automata and formal language simulations!

Thank you for being part of this journey.
