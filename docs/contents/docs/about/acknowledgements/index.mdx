I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the following individuals and resources that helped shape this project.  

A special thanks to Professor **Dr. Sumesh Divakaran**, whose classes were the sole reason I got interested in Formal Languages and Automata Theory. His teaching was both insightful and engaging, and his explanations of concepts like soundness and completeness truly inspired me to dive deeper into the subject.

- **Peter Linz's** _An Introduction to Formal Languages and Automata_
- **Michael Sipser's** _Introduction to the Theory of Computation_

These two resources provided invaluable help in understanding the theoretical foundations that were essential for this project.

Thanks to [**AriaDocs**](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/documentation-template), a Next.js documentation template. It saved me a lot of time and effort, as I didnâ€™t need to design a documentation site from scratch.  

Thanks to everyone who supported and encouraged me.
